# Coding Challenge #1 Stepper form (Colt Steele YouTube)

This is a code challenge from Colt Steele’s YouTube channel, the task was to build a Stepper form in under two hours. 
The idea was to get the form working using JS, the CSS/making the form look good was not a primary concern. However, 
I thought it would give myself an extra hour just to work on the styles as it could be cool to add to my portfolio.

(Note: this was not my own UI design but one of Colt Steele’s as this was a coding challenge not a design challenge)
